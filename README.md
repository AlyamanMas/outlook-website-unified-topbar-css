# Outlook Website Unified Topbar Custom CSS
This makes the ribbon/menu bars unified into one instead of two separate bars to save screen real estate

In order to use, you can install the browser extension "Stylus" and import this file, or find the same project published and importable directly from Stylus by opening Stylus while on the Outlook website.
